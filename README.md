# SC1015-final-project-group-7
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> This is our (FCS3 Team 07) mini-project for SC1015 Data Science & Artificial Intelligence 2024. The aim of our project is to create a model that predicts whether released songs on Spotify will be successful based on certain variables. </br>
Our measurement of success is revenue, which is the most tangible factor that many people base on to evaluate the movies worthiness.
The dataset we will be using is (30000 Spotify Songs)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs] from (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/]. </p>

<h1> Conclusion </h1>
<h2>Key Findings and Project Limitations</h2>
Our exploration of the 30,000 song dataset yielded valuable insights, but also highlighted limitations that future efforts can address:
<ol>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Temporal Focus: </p> The majority of songs belonged to the post-2010 era. This suggests the model's predictions might be more applicable to contemporary music.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Artist Influence: </p> A strong correlation emerged between past artist performance and the popularity of new songs. This underscores the importance of artist reputation in influencing success.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Genre Trends: </p> Pop music dominated the dataset in terms of popularity, while rock held the least prominent position. However, these findings may not reflect the broader musical landscape.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Model Accuracy: </p> While the model captured some aspects of song popularity, its limitations require further development for practical use. Predicting the success of artistic works is inherently complex, as numerous factors beyond the scope of our data (marketing, catchiness, regional appeal) play a role.
  </li>
</ol>
These insights provide a foundation for future iterations of the project.

<h1> Future improvements: </h1>

<h2> External Data Integration: </h2>
<p> Go beyond the initial 30,000 song dataset by incorporating external sources. This could include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Artist Demographics: </p> Include region of origin, genre popularity in specific regions, and artist's historical performance data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Marketing Spend: </p> If available, incorporate data on marketing expenses associated with each song.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Social Media Buzz: </p> Analyze social media mentions and sentiment surrounding the song's release.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Subjective Feature Representation: </p> Address the challenge of capturing subjective qualities like "catchiness." We can explore:
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Crowdsourcing: </p> Design surveys to get user ratings on aspects like catchiness, memorability, or emotional impact.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Music Theory Analysis: </p> Analyze features like chord progressions, melodic patterns, and rhythmic complexity that might influence audience perception.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced Model Exploration:</h2>
<p>While the initial model might be simpler, let's explore the potential of more sophisticated approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Neural Networks: </p> Utilize deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to directly analyze audio features. CNNs can extract complex patterns from raw audio data, potentially capturing aspects like melody, rhythm, and instrumentation that influence popularity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold"> Text Analysis: </p> Employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze song lyrics or artist interviews. Sentiment analysis of lyrics could reveal emotional themes that resonate with listeners.
  </li>
</ul>
 
 
<p> By incorporating these enhancements, we can create a more comprehensive model that considers not just inherent song characteristics but also external factors and subjective user perception. This will lead to a more robust and nuanced understanding of song popularity. </p>
